# Wordle Tweet Data Analysis

# About
This project analyzes tweet data from the daily word game Wordle. The objective is to run a full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using various techniques for data wrangling and visualization using python, pandas, and matplotlib.

# Requirements
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.7.16 installed and the following libraries:

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`

You can install them via pip using the following command:

```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn```

# Setup

1. Clone or download the project from the Github repository: **https://github.com/your-username/wordle-tweet-data-analysis.git**
2. Navigate to the project directory on your local machine.
3. Ensure that you have the required libraries installed (see the "Requirements" section above).
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook file "wordle_tweet_data_analysis.ipynb".

# Usage

Once you have set up the project and opened the Jupyter Notebook file, you can run the cells to perform the following tasks:

* Load in the dataset and parse tweet text.
* Determine how many tweets we have for each date and plot the data.
* Analyze the number of attempts by Wordle ID and create a heatmap.
* Analyze how many attempts it usually takes to solve a Wordle and plot the data.

You can modify the code to analyze different aspects of the data or create new visualizations.

# Conclusion

This project provides an introduction to data analysis using Python and various libraries. By analyzing tweet data from the daily word game Wordle, we have demonstrated various techniques for data wrangling and visualization. These techniques can be applied to other datasets to gain insights and inform decision-making.
